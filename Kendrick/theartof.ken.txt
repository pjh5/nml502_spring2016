[Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the Federales will roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches in trouble
I hope the universe love you today
cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill their body with hate, if it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy' first album, looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hot-boxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
and asked them what they working with, look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth, usually I'm drug-free
But shit, I'm with the homies

(Yeah nigga, we off of pill and Remy Red
 Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
 where my niggas pour up fo' and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my motherfucking niggas
 Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter of fact, I hope out that motherfucker
 and be like, do-do-do-do~! Do-do-do-do-do~!)

It's 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke, and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy, and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 4-0-5, passing Westchester
You know the light-skinned girls in all their little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from round there
cause every time we down there, we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked the conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like, then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger
I mean I never was stranger to the folk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick, and then we laugh about it
That's ironic cause I've never been violent
until I'm with the homies

(Just riding, just riding)
Me and the homies
(Bullshitting, acting a fool)
Me and the homies
(Tripping, really tripping)
Me and the homies
(Just riding, just riding, just riding)

Bragging bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, beefing if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still, nigga what is you saying?
Pull in front of the house that we've been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called, kicking it
I should have told her I'm probably bout to catch my first offense
with the homies

{*police sirens ring*}

But they made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

(And this is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure)
Me and the homies
(This is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure)
Me and the homies
(And this is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure)
Me and the homies
(This is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure)
