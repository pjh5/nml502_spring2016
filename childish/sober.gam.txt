[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high

[Childish Gambino]
Girl, what's your problem
Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Ooh honey now girl, we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you le-e-et it shine
You can free-ee-ee your mind, cause I know

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Girl, if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Ooh honey now girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be, ohh, na no-no

And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober (I want to be the only one)
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so- (yeah)

That.. that I'm so high... (yeah)
That I'm so high
That I'm so high
That.. that I'm so high
That I'm so high (woo!)
That I'm so high (uh)

And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high, babe
But now I'm so high, nah nah
But now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
Ohh, now I'm so high {*harmonizes to the end*}
