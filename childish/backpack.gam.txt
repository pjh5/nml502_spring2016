[Childish Gambino]
Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk About His Dick Again
Nerdy-ass black kid; whatever man, I'm sick of him
That well spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm dude, show respect
Somethin crazy, an Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walkin out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short-shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-Baby-Say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homey
But I rap like these niggaz ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck English
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin? rap is for real blacks
I hate that fuckin faggot man he think that we feel that"
Or "I wrote on rap culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth, before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now, or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

[Chorus]
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy gettin brain like Krang
What, what's my name in the woods got these niggaz usin MapQuest
Man, fuck a backpacker

[Childish Gambino]
Niggaz with OCD, nWO
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No co-sign, trigonometry
Man these niggaz hate me
"Man, fuck you nigga... fuck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin her
Clash of the titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
"Super Bass" super face inside her garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggaz wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that~! Boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin on that payback, comin on that Ma$e took
I'm comin' on some real shit, I'm comin on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uhh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Fuck these backpackers!! {*3X*}
HUH?!!</pre>
