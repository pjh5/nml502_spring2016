[Childish Gambino]
Okay it's Childish Gambino homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls cause man fuck it I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude I should be runnin'PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird, like 'nigga' with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin in the islands lookin for +Earl+ like +Toejam+
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
Cause I'm a beast, bitch, +Gir+, +Invader Zim+
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggaz like slavery
Told me I was awful man that shit did not phase me
Tell me how I suck again my memory is hazy
"You're my favorite rapper now" Yeah dude I better be
Or you can fuckin'kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man why does every black actor gotta rap some?"
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin everythinh you muh'fuckers talk about

[Childish Gambino]
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin
Fuck that, got goons like an arch-villain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit: "First of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now nigga that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me cause yo' little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin "Owwww"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it - Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune
I'll give you all of me until there's nothin left
I swear this summer will be summer +Camp+, bitch </pre>
