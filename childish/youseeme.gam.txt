Artist: Childish Gambino (Donald Glover)
Album:  Camp
Song:   You See Me
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
I'm on my ballin each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA

[Childish Gambino]
I'm on my isssssssssssh, call it
I watch these haters take they shots like they were alcoholics
"What is he wearin? Somebody jack that fool's steeze"
If I'm a faggot spell it right, I got way more than two G's
Nigga I'm amazin, I'm a phenom, I'm assassin, I'ma kill y'all
I'ma say "mama-se mama-sa mama-ku-sa"
And this shit's closed now cause I ball too hard
And I'm cummin on her face, have I gone too far?
I don't know, who cares, I don't love that broad
And it's funny how these fake niggaz always act hard
I'm a black star in a black car with a black card
They wanna knock me out; they tryin nigga~!
Realest motherfucker in the game like Tron nigga
Forget these white girls, I need some variation
... especially if she very Asian
She got an ugly friend? Roll solo
Can I stay at your place? No hobo
Not my fault man, these ladies love me
She's an overachiever cause all she do is +suck seed+

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Send me naked pics, I'ma Tumbl that
I'm the shit, been the shit, fuck a humble brag
Yeah we pushin that, and her pussycat
I got swag out my ass so I'm usin that
Textin with Olivia Munn, hopefully she'll give me some
Or some Rosie Jones man, hoes is hoes is hoes man
Racks on racks on racks man, all I got is tracks man
Sorry for my accent, but I've been practicin
Everywhere you go niggaz blastin that Gambino
Niggaz be like "Ye ain't know?"
Bitches be like "Ye ain't know?"
Met this fly Latino, hope that she eighteen though
If she not, I'll say that I got deep throat in Heathrow

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Told me I was shit, but that shit couldn't stop me
A nigga still hungry, black Kobayashi
When I talk about you I hear a "Who?" like Horton
I was born for this shit, you a rappin abortion
Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?
Can we try somethin new and not be suspect?
I don't really know, we fucked up bad
You don't wanna see my dudes when they get mad
I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me
that'll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee
And laugh while they masturbatin all over your beaten body
Sick boy forever, that Suburban Illuminati
Naw nigga, yeah, we never stop
No period like menopause
No period like, "Oh shit!
Am I the only one you sleepin with?
...
Am I the only one you sleepin with?"</pre>
