[Chorus]
Where we were both kinda thing
Betchya cry, all alone
Where we were both kinda thing
Betchya cry, all alone
Where we were both kinda thing
Betchya cry, all alone

[Verse 1]
Rec League, I ain't handball
Y'all be string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah. I murder some, I murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah what you saying to it?
Old money look no money don't do it
Nigga coming round in they lane like a Huey
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her booty) So ratchet now
They wanna smoke niggas, but they Black & Mild
So we opted out
Ok cool

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Blue drink by the bouquet
'Til I'm blue faced on a Tuesday
(Can I have some?)
#NiggasBeLike
Put a plus eighteen on that e-vite
And I said what I felt, no re-write
Nah nah, they can't hold me
Shrooms a lot, drop something
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scortch women, I'm turnt up
Gut niggas, so curb balling
Elle Varner got a crush on him
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like 2 Chainz
Blue blood like Wolf Gang

[Chorus]
