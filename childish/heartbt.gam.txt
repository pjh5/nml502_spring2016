Artist: Childish Gambino (Donald Glover)
Album:  Camp
Song:   Heartbeat
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I wanted you to know, that I am ready to go
Heartbeat, a heartbeat
I wanted you to know, whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

[Childish Gambino]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over
When it's all over, no settling down
My text go to your screen, you know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sittin at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinkin that the song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start callin, you start cryin
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you; the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til it come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place; cause

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chillin with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
she's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin
I'm paranoid that these girls want somethin from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong; askin him if she wanna play games
with the +Super Smash Bros.+ but none of 'em you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
is only thing girls want when you in that smokin light

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool~! He ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You coulda wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggaz that you say you hate
You know that I'm the best when I'm a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist
I give you money then you burn me,like you made off
She ain't a killer but she'd fuckingblow your head off
I know he wonderin "What the fuck you hiding"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Aiyyofuck this
Are we datin? Are we fuckin?
Are we best friends? Are we somethin
in between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean that
But not really
You say the nastiest shit in bed and it's fuckin awesome</pre>
