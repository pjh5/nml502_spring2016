[Childish Gambino]
I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
I'm hopin that it's cause I'm livin everything I want
I'm used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
playin with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights, puttin on a stone face
He's savin up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sound fancy to me
They called me fat nose, my mom say "You handsome to me"
"Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
 but he's actin up in class and keeps peein in his pants"
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helpin me out
They talkin hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talkin hood shit and "Coolin' Out" like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
Seven dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messagin hopin that can patch up shit
But all they get now is "Can your son read this script?"

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside; we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside - no one knows

[Childish Gambino]
Yeah; dad lost his job, momma worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face she still made dinner
"Donald watch the meter, so they don't turn the lights off"
Workin two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my Grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He's supposed to pay 'em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow
Like that would do somethin
But she's got six kids, she gotta do somethin
She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain't around - he lookin at me now, like
"Why you so fuckin lucky~? I had a father too
 But he ain't around so I'ma take it out on you"
We used to say "I love you," now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin what you are because you're young and black
Don't believe 'em
You're still that kid that kept the older boys from teasin
For some reason

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Can you hear me now? {*2X*}
Oh, help us Lord
Oh, baby baby baby baby</pre>
