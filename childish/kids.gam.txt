[Chorus]
If we were kids
I'd want to give you everything that you would want
Those other boys
They gave you toys, but all they wanna do is
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up

[Childish Gambino]
I guess I'm fuckin now; I'm gettin used to it
It's cause I shine and I ain't gotta use a crucifix
Fuck the fussin and fightin and arguin to this and that
And "Why you bein mean to me Donald?" I never texted back
I know it's comin quick, wishin I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to Alpha male, because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mailroom I ain't had a shot in hell
I called her ass for 2 months and heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when the chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck but I still like
If we were kids I had the black K-Swiss and Reebok
If we were kids I wouldn't act like this, but we not

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
You made a mistake; these dudes man you +Bathing+ in +Apes+
Finding you is likeh findin Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish nah, I'm skippin all of it
Black or white girls come with a set of politics
That's all I was sayin, I'm a proud man
They wanna holla when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes but she push a brown Focus
And she's doin coke in front of me but act like I don't notice
"There any breakage in that Trojan?" She see what she wanna see
So I make her take Plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbin hoes like O.J.
They too busy trappin pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before +me+ is +do re+
If you had told me the truth, we'd be okay

[Chorus]
