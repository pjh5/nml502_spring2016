[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
If this is my last shh- my last shit
Uhh, it definitely be mad important
Still a, chain smokin', name droppin' (ey man, this sound like a Prince song)
Good lookin', muh'fuckin', motha- shut your mouth!

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Still a chain smokin', name droppin'
Good lookin', muh'fuckin', motha - shut yo' mouth!
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listenin', stain hittin'
Satin woodgrain grippin', paint drippin', motha - shut yo' mouth!

[Chance The Rapper]
Somebody pray for the God, oh Lord, I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit, rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid and sniffin' glue and chewin' Vicodin
Shoulda died yellin' "YOLO was a lie" and you a liar, wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike and I'm afraid that this one right here, might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang but I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ainâ€™t tryna go out at all, got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last chance joint gotta be a dance joint from an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint, old school for my own old man joint

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Chance The Rapper]
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit (IGH!)

[Chance The Rapper]
Why toss my filter, when she saved my life?
The same shit that kills us, always taste so right
That's why I pray to the dear Lord, God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me, introduced me to the lucy leaf
Ohh ohh ohh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
BIC flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire, flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night; in the sky I get higher, higher, okay

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Chance The Rapper]
IGH!
