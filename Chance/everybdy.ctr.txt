[Intro: sample of Slum Village's "Fall In Love"] + (Chance)
"Ladies lovin' my music is like some sex shit
"Niggas tryin' to grip up my mic like it's a dick" (on the mic like it's a dick)
"Run around the corner to pick up the new shit" (the, the shit)
"Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep" (Brook!)
"Ladies lovin' my music is like some sex shit" (gyeah)
"Niggas tryin' to grip up my mic like it's a dick" (na-na-na-na)
"Run around the corner to pick up the new shit" (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
"Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep" (na-na-na-na-na-na-oohhhh - IGH!)

[Chance The Rapper]
What's good, good? And what's good, evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sendin' him
Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills, down I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya kna wha mean? I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aimin' back cause the cops shot you
BUCK BUCK BANG BANG - yellin' "FUCK Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothaFUCK opps too
Ain't no knucklin' up 'em young cause it just not cool

[Interlude: Chance The Rapper]
Nice to see you Father New Year, middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shootin' death with weighted dice and hittin' stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
Cause they help me beat my demons ass

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper + BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything (I know you right)
Nobody's nothing (that's right)
Everybody's somebody's everything (I know you right)
Nobody's nothing (that's right)
Everybody's somebody's everything (that's right)
Nobody's nothing (I know you right)

[Chance The Rapper]
Right? (IGH!) I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black but they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but my hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancin' with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
in two small point ballet shoes with a missin' sole
and two missin' toes but it's love like Cupid kissin' a mistletoe

[Interlude]

[Saba]
Like Cassius duckin' the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fightin' odors; coppers and quotas
+Hold Ya Head+ like 2Pac had taught, obviously they are on a come up
with better chances tobogganin' in the fuckin' summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against we tryna get lucky; doper than Lucky
You're ending happy that's only a tuggin'
Like Satan masturbatin' shit come hot but y'all still love me, ah
How father time a deadbeat, maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless - IGH~!

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper + BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything - NIGGA~!
Nobody's nothing - NIGGA~!
Everybody's somebody's everything - NIGGA~!
Nobody's nothing (Wu-Tang)
Everybody's somebody's everything (thats right)
Nobody's nothing (I know you right)
Nobody..
