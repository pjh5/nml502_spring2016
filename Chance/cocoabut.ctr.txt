[Chance The Rapper]
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na - IGH!
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na - IGH!

[Chorus One 2X: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses...
I miss my cocoa butter kisses...

[Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alky, keep it lowkey/Loki like Thor lil bro
or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wildin'/Wile E. like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outtie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yellin' "fuck me", two weeks she'll be yellin' "fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fuckin' hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go huntin'
BLAM~!!

[Chorus One]

[Vic Mensa]
Innanet... Innanet
I will, smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be askin' "how's it goin'?" Say the goings, well
Go figure, Victor's light skinned, Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell
All praise to the God; God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COIN-TEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom, let you know me well
I mean normally, you see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high, burn trees, smoke chlorophyll
'til they can't feel shit, shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thang got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, +Miseducated+, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it, probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz, asshole, absynthe up in that glass
+Are We There Yet?+ Ice Cubes in a bong; rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass
I think we all addicted, yeah...
I think we all addicted, really though...
I think we all addicted, yup...
I think we all addicted

[Chorus Two: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses...
I think we all addicted...

[Chorus One] - 1X w/ Vic Mensa singing along

[Twista]
Twista~!
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy; used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie, I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy; you be, flowin' about drugs and a Uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes, sometimes I'mma wanna +Make A Movie+
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (yeah); and though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron (yeah) cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off of OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see (what) never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key (haha) don't, be, so, judg-ment-al
Even though I'm reminiscing I f I don't know what I (what) miss is, I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter (what) kisses, this is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thankin' (yes); I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't cause I'm stankin' (no) never too old for a spanking - IGH!

[Chorus Two]
