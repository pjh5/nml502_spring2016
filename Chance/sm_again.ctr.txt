[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
IGH! Hmm-mm-mmm (IGH!)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da - +Acid Rap+!

[Chorus 2X: chopped and screwed voice]
I don't even talk to them on the phone again, leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again, I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do

[Chance The Rapper]
Who smokin in my car? It's that nigga Chano
AKA Mr. Bennett, AK Tony Montano
I've got some folks in low end, I got some folks in c-note
AK hundred dinero, you ever seen Casino?
I just got back with 'Bino, I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino - that's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with Cheese and a kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt, that's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam, that's why my hands stay ready
Flip the candy yum, that's the fuckin' bombest
Lean all on the square - that's a FUCKIN' rhombus

[Chorus] - 2X

[Chance the Rapper]
Who's sneakin' in the club? That's that young Sir Rapper
Un-saran wrap the purple, wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window, cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter, you just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on, I'm your, bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap, raps but better when I sing, songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on; killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon, savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron, dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch, drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face - that's a work of art

[Chorus] - 2X

[Ab-Soul]
Soulo ho, ho twerk somethin' (Soulo) throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin' (Soulo)
I'm so def, I ain't ever heard nothin'; my name Herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)
Heh, how 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
+No Doubt+ like Gwen Stefani's group, look let me put my mouth where you potty, boo
(Hahaha) IGH! I can't get that, yeah
Them niggas pissed, need potty trainin', they movement shit, that's a potty train (uh)
She ain't left yet, but she probably came, we kicked it then I scored - soccer game (yeah)
She was a phony goalie, I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me, my name Soulo cause I'm the one and only (Soulo)
She only got you as a nigga on the side - that's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie (ay)
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper
Soul~!

[Chorus] - 2X
