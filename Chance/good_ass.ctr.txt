[Intro: BJ The Chicago Kid, Lili K., Peter Cottontale, Kiara Lanier] + (Chance)
Even better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (yo we back)
I'm good, ooohh yeah, I'm good
Even better than I was the last time baby (IGH!)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh - I'm good, so good
(And we back and we back and we back and we back)
(And we back and we back and we back and we back)
Even better than I was the last time

[Chance The Rapper]
Rap's just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'mma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancin' on sporadicity and fuckin' pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain I got some motherfuckin' bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid, Lili K., Peter Cottontale, Kiara Lanier]
Better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh - I'm good, yeah, I'm good, so good
Better than I was the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh - I'm good, so good

[Chance The Rapper]
Work, work, work, work - bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve - dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldnâ€™t be better, kickin' dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexin' my lungs
See them showin' they teeth, that's just them flappin' they gums
If they bite and I'm snappin', clap clap collapsin' they lungs
Call me Chancellor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"
Magical word (POOF) please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch, my stuff the fuckin' bomb
I'm the motherfuckin' fucker, fuck a niggas fuckin' dumb
This your favorite fuckin' album and ain't even fuckin' done
I'm good! IGH!

[Chorus] w/ ad-libs

[Chance The Rapper] + (Lili K. + Kaira Lanier)
Even better that I was, even better than I was
Even better that I was, even better than I was
(I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be)
Even better that I was, even better than I was
Even better that I was, even better than I was
(I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be)
So, so, so, so, so, so, so so so so so so so so so
(I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be)
So, so, so, so, so, so, so so so so so so...
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job and I'm good
Na-na-na-na-na-na-naa
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na - IGH, IGH, IGH, IGH, IGH!!
IGH~!</pre>
