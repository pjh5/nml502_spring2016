[Intro]
La la la, laaaa
La la laaaaaa {*AUGHHHHHH!*}

[Tyler, the Creator]
Satan's gettin jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferrin us
Books on not givin a fuck is what they referrin us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderous
And young enough to get the fuckin priest to come and flirt with us
You niggaz rap about fuckin bitches and gettin head
Instead I rap about fuckin bitches and gettin heads
While you niggaz stackin bread, I can stack a couple dead bodies
Makin red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhymin pattern matter
then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore'
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
that make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours
(Umbrella) I hate this, screamin fuck patience
Got a nigga shakin like the calmest fuckin Haitian
after chronic masturbation, askin where Mary-Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn +Bullwinkle+ the red +Moose+
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She run around this motherfuckin dungeon, her legs loose
until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops

[Tyler, the Creator]
Victim, victim, honey you're my fifth one
Honey on that toppin when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fuckin death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
with a leaf of salad and some dressing pourin out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fuckin bottom of a sneaker
J+eeper+ the fuckin +Creeper+, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great
Now it's time to +Fish-her+ like +Derek+
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
and snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's tryin to suck our dick
Hippopot the fuckin llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fuckin bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex Mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up
Yep~!

[Tyler, the Creator]
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
when you tell a fuckin orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's Disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fuckin Mexicans crossin the border (arriba!)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
cause I'll be too fuckin busy trin to flirt with Jesus' daughter
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starvin Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Nazi bar mitzvah
wit'cha sister at the bar playin leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the +Pooh+ like +Tigger+ dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "Yeah Bob this nigger's sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snortin Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
being the only bastard in a Box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
in some Kanye West glasses screamin out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic takin photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

{What the fuck?}
{I'm... speechless... that was... fuck}
{Shit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help}
{I'm not a... fuck it, different subject}
{How's that girl you were tellin me about?}</pre>
