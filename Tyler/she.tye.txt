[Frank Ocean]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (on the block)
She been plottin on my brown cock (brown cock)
Last night, I slept over hers (over hers) 
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back - pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin on the grass
..A real ninja with the blade and the mask
Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but..
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's yo' ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin it's wiser to exit with dude

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
see you in the, dark when you're sleepin
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window... 
He's at your window...

[Tyler, the Creator]
Swag...
The night light hits off, I'm turnin kisses to BITES
I'm a down to Earth nigga, with intentions, that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna FUCK
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope!)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writin songs about we
We as including +I+, and yourself, makin three
Little ones, drums are hittin pretty hard if you ask me (Yeah..)
You're a pretty broad in the top three
of things that I've been waitin to come, so
Meet me by the lake around ten and skinny dippin and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure in Time

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Tyler]
One, two, you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin go-rgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
and fornicate, with it but that's because I'm in love with you (...cunt)
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk, you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt~!) 
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk, you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Tyler]
One, two, you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin go-rgeous (Gorgeous...)
