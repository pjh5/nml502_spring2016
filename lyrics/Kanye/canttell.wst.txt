[Kanye](Jeezy)
La La La La (YEAH)
Wait till I get my money right

[Verse 1]
I had a dream I can buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless (Why are we...late)
To what much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, got some chilli, get the message (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Bought more jewlery, more Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me (Oh oh oh oh oh)
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man (Why are we...late)
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I aint going Hill man (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forget where I came from

[Chorus - Kanye](Jeezy)
La La La La (HEY)
Wait till I get my money right
La La La La (YEAH)
Then you can't tell me nothing right (Why are we...late)
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (YEAH)
You can't tell me nothing (HAHA)
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2]
Let up the suice doors
This is my life homey, you decide yours (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars (Why are we...late)
So I parrallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day (Oh oh oh oh oh)
But homey this is my day, class started 2 hours ago
Oh am I late? (Oh oh oh oh oh)
You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it (Oh oh oh oh oh)
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Uhhh they so sensitive (Why are we...late)
Don't ever fix your lips like colligen
And say something when you gon end up apologing (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Let me know if it's a problem man, aight man, holla then

[Chorus]

[verse3]
Let the champaigne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get pass (Oh oh oh oh oh)
You don't needa stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off the fumes cause (Why are we...late)
How you move in a room full of nose?
How you stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, HUH, depending how you dress her (Oh oh oh oh oh)
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher (Why are we...late)
But way less effort, cause when you try hard
that's when you die hard (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Ya homies looking like +Why God?+
When they reminice over you my God

[Chorus]
