[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
I know you see me now right now (I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (right now)
I know you see me now right now

[Kanye over Chorus] 
You see? 
See? Ha ha, yeah

[Beyoncé + Kanye]
I got my suit and tie, and I don't know if y'all know
Well maybe y'all do, or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care
It's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go

[Kanye West]
Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with WHO? That's old news
I'm in a speed boat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu, with no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you!"
Immature adult insecure asshole (what else?)
If you fall on the concrete, that's your asphalt/ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last thought
Get what you ask for, I swear that's your ass so
She got a big, booty but she couldn't drop that ass low
'Til you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow
When you gettin money they be all up on your ass yo
When you gettin money Kan's don't let a nigga pass go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell him I said "Hello"
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said "HELL NO!"
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

[Beyoncé] + (Kanye)
My niggaz is home, I guess I got everything, everything I want
(Let's go shoppin dawg, let's celebrate) But I don't
No matter how good it gets (free Weezy though)
It'll never be like before
No women in the crowd, screamin and it's loud
Doin things not allowed, and I swear it's goin down right now
(You know what it is) I know one thing, my momma would be proud
And you see me lookin up, cause I know she's lookin down right now

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got her man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit, my first watch was a Fossil
Now I'm in the Louvre, lookin for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whip's on the Sprewells, it's so un-Caaaamry
Somebody need to put us on caaaamera
The world of Roley's and everyone faaaamilies
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferrari's
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Bonnie's
End up at Marley, Georgio, service from Sergio
The keen Lamborghini, chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellafied vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, 32
Lyrically can't none of y'all murder 'Ye
Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae
I got styled last June and she heard of me/ May
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies G.D.'s, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality

[Beyoncé + Kanye]
Now go get my throne, cause I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone, and I'ma make it hot
'Til it's time to go, when it's time to go
Where you tryin to go? You better act like you can see me now

[Chorus]- repeat 2X

[Kanye West over Chorus]
Exactly! Rosewood! Uh-huh, uh-huh

I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D

[Verse Three: Big Sean]
Today I am the freshest in the world but that's just obvious
Damn I look so sexy and you look like a polishing
When I told my ex I love her, she went and married another
And changed her name up, you know you so sloppy, chick
Be successful, that's what that told me
Now everything I D.O.,now I O.D.
They say G.O.O.D music like the new Miami Heat
Shit, comparing them to us, man they gotta add Kobe
Moly Holy moly, went from G-Shock in a rolly
From the D copping in Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley
Naw, naw, +Baby Boy+, you Jody, in the party they all know me
Yeah, I saw your ass in line, boy, you was looking like the old me
Presidential suit, my girl's Michelle in Chanel
She gave me deisnger (unh) she keep it all natual
She said again I'm chasing cheese, dodging rat traps
Chasing pussy, you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, youse a nasty chick
Ooooooh, you know I like that nasty shhhh
Got it made every way, getting paid everyday
What Sean sound like? Ye protegee? Naw he sound like he a pro to me
I know Kanye a jerk, how can you say that?
He rolled me and my mama round in his Maybach
What kinda jerk is that? What kinda jerks are ya'll?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
I bet you take it off, or chase him through the mall
We working twice as hard so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls, we be getting paid like double twos
Rep Westside throwing up "W"s We leave you, Sean, I love you too
Oooh-oooh, you know how I do!

[Outro: Kanye West]
That what it is, black excellence baby
This is the elite, yeah
We the greatest in the world baby
We the greatest in the world! {*laughs*}
Yeah, Lex Luger, No I.D., Yeezy
