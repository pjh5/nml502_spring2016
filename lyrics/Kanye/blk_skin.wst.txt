[Kanye West]
For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My "by any means" on
Pardon, I'm gettin my screams on
Enter the king-dom
But watch who your bring home
You see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor, they gon' come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me and my black skin
Number one question they askin
{FUCK EVERY QUESTION YOU ASKIN}
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
in comes the Conservative Baptists
Claimin I'm overreactin
like the black kids in Chi-raq, bitch

Fo' in the morning, and I'm zonin
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it +300+, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin, in the moment
I've been a menace, for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, AND YOU KNOW IT!
(AHH!)

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (DOWN!) 
I'm doin 500, I'm out of control (NOW!) 
But there's nowhere to go (NOW!) 
And there's no way to slow (DOWN!)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I woulda been blacked out on yo' ass

Fo' in the morning, and I'm zonin
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it +300+, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin, in the moment
I've been a menace, for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, AND YOU KNOW IT!!
(AHH!)

Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up ya whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a KING
{*inhales*} Back out the tomb, bitch!
Black out the room, bitch!
Stop all that coon shit!
These niggaz ain't doin shit!
Them niggaz ain't doin shit!!
C'mon homie, what happened?
You niggaz ain't breathin, you gaspin
These niggaz ain't ready for action
-ready, -ready for action, -action

Fo' in the morning, and I'm zonin
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it +300+, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin, in the moment
I've been a menace, for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, AND YOU KNOW IT!!!
(AHH!)

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (DOWN!) 
I'm doin 500, I'm out of control (NOW!) 
But there's nowhere to go (NOW!) 
And there's no way to slow (DOWN!)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I woulda been blacked out on yo' ass

God!! God!! God!!
God!! God!! God!! God!!!
God!!! God!! God!!! God!!!
