[James Fauntleroy II]
What of the dollar you murdered for
Is that the one fightin for your soul
Or your brother's the one that you're runnin from
But if you got money, fuck it, cause I want some

BIG... fuckin with me...

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin with my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muthafuckin
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the

[Big Sean]
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I'm comin out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
Yup, She tryin get me that poo-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
I'm rollin with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr! I'm pullin up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fuckin villain, man, they kneelin when I'm walkin in the buildin
Freaky women I be feelin from the bank accounts I'm fillin
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that's killin everything that he see

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm talkin 'Ye, yeah, I'm talkin Rih'
Yeah, I'm talkin B, nigga, I'm talkin me
Yeah, I'm talkin bossy, I ain't talkin Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talkin to me
Yeah I'm talkin LeBron, we ballin our family tree
G.O.O.D Music drug dealin cousin, ain't nothin fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a... man ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation, I'm the shit, at least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years, ain't hug his son since the second grade
He never told, who we gonna tell, we top of the totem pole
It's the dream team, meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green it only means one thing
You ain't fuckin with my clique

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival - the Un-American idols
What niggaz did in Paris, got em' hangin off the Eiffel
Yeah I'm talkin business, we talkin CIA
I'm talkin George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig'nant
I know Spike Lee gone kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everythin I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompei
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Everytime I'm in Vegas they screamin like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that
But I been talkin to God for so long
And if you look at my life I guess he's talkin back
Fuckin with my clique

[Chorus]
