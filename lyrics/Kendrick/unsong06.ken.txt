[Kendrick Lamar]
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I seeee
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflict in meeee

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (CeeLo Green)
Oh! But don't be scared of me girl (I can explain)
I know it's foreign to you, I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor (let me explain)
More than a compliment, and I could use some assistance
Let me show you how (I can explain)
Oh, oh shando, I spin around two times
I'll be there with the answer (let me explain)

[CeeLo Green]
I'm bizarre; avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive; you're intrigued
Am I +Mortal Man+ or make believe?
Anything you want (I can explain) I can explain it
Any misunderstandings baby (let me explain) I can explain it
Why don't you sit and talk to me awhile? (I can explain) let me explain it
Ahhhh yes (let me explain)

[Kendrick Lamar]
My momma told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways, praise the Lord
You teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant, I mean we
love a woman and think we can satisfy her between sheets
Covers and pillows
I'm promisin' your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
I'm promisin' that I'm acknowledgin' you as my hero cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed but I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws, look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it, you and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar] + (CeeLo Green)
Because I know for sure who you are (I can explain)
Your momma raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washin' your clothes on Sunday (let me explain)
Walking your brother to school
Three miles away to feed him knowledge so (I can explain)
Don't you explain that
Don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels (let me explain)
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you but don't you EVER (let me explain)
Oh, oh shando, I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise~! (I can explain)
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the odd, I am yours (I can explain)
I am yours, I am yours, I am yours
I am yoooours, yoooours, yoooours

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Ndiseza, ndingene, khaluma, vumile (yoooours, yoooours)
Ndiseza, ndingene, khaluma, vumile (yoooours)
