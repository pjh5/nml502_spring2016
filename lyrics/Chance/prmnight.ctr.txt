Artist: Chance The Rapper
Album:  10 Day (Mixtape)
Song:   Prom Night
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Charlie Bartlett, John Bender
Class Switcher, Time Bender
Chance Bennett a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair
Fun fact, I'm never going back to school
Been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night

[Chorus: x2]
And it's alright
And it's ok
And we're all good
We're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 2]
Uh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo and snap a couple candid's of the family
Get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jan who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like "Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up"
Cause honestly I've always loved the way you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night

[Chorus]

[Outro]
So good, So right
Hey baby, so good, so right
You know it feels so good
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight</pre>
