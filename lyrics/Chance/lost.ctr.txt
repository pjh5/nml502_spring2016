[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
My druggy, love me when I'm ugly
Hug me when I'm bummy, scummy; I'm your hubby
Let's get lo-ost... let's get lo-ost...

[Chance The Rapper]
Damn I'm in so deep girl, probably cause you're empty
You can't even speak girl; damn your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me, daddy wouldn't let you 
if he ever met me, if he ever met you
Put that shit behind us, and put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums, minus all that shit its lined with
I say oh-oh-oh-ohh - you been scratchin, you been fiendin
I'mma fix you, I'mma fuck you, I'mma get rid of them demons - it's my

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper + woman]
My druggy.. when I'm ugly
Hug me when I'm bummy, scummy; I'm your hubby
Let's get lo-ost... let's get lo-ost...

[Chance The Rapper]
Damn I need a minute... aight leh'go
She fell in love, it fell apart... aight leh'go
She met her match, I let her match, she lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah me mad petty, yeah me bogus, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah me know
Yeah she knew too (IGH!) it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like fuck it
So dance for daddy like Gator, ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room and find yourself in my grip - I'm sayin

[Chorus]

[Noname Gypsy]
I blessed myself inside your arms one day, swear to God there I was when the dress
And the Silver buttons fade away; Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seein' my psychiatrist: she said "pill, pop, baby, girl 
cause I promise you, you tweaked; the empty bottled loneliness
This happiness you seek" the masochism that you preach
Practice back flips, tragic actress on a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

[Chorus]

[Chance The Rapper]
IGH!
