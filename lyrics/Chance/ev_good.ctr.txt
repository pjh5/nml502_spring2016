[Intro: Chance's father] + (Chance)
Well I should have you hooked up next week
(It's all good or whatever, I can, I can wait 'til my birthday. I uh-)
No, no, no, no. I told ya, I know you need it now, so next week I promise you I'll have you hooked up, okay?
(Uh, alright. I just wanted to say thank you, for uh, for everything. For the, the computer and, the T-shirts, and uh, all the other stuff)
You know, Chance. Let me tell you something.
You know, I could never be more proud of anything in my life, you know, than I am of you and what you've done.
Chance, you have done, remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything.
I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing.
I am very, very proud of you. Just keep doing what you're doing, ok?
(Thank you, love you) Alright, son. Love you too, take care
(Aight, bye bye)

Thanks for comin' guys...

'Member sittin' in class the first time listenin' to Dillaaaa
Everything's good...
Rubbin' on yo chin, sippin Gin, Margiela brand chinchillaaaa
Everything's good...
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarilloooos
and some fruit snacks, and some killer
Phone numbers on speed dial call them save monkey guerillaaaas
Everything's good...
I ain't really that good at goodbyes, I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses even persons leave em hurtin' bleedin
I ain't really help the helpless, I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses, I'm good like books in churches
Harold's and hooks and churches, everything's good...
See my name when you google search it, use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's good...
But I knew it was fly when I was just a caterpillaaaar
That I'd make it even if I never make a millaaaa
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chilliiiin'
And everything's good...
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creepin'
Now I'm out workin' evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends
rehearsin' verses, murderin' merch and events
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta and it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account...
Off of songs I barely could think up cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound...
I'm better than I was the last tiiiiime -- crescendo
Thanks Justin, lendin' them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto, the time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Na-na-na, hey hey, +Good Intro+
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thrillerrrrr...
Remember the first time you heard this dude and thought damn that's that niggaaaaa, haha
Everything's good...

Na-na-na-na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-na-na-na-nah, na-na-na-na-na-na-nah
