[Intro/Interlude: Chance The Rapper]
Thirsty, thirsty, tryna choose
I mean, I know, I'm pretty cool (IGH!)
My Nitty bag, my kitty boost
I got the juice, I got the juice (IGH!)

[Chance The Rapper]
Chano, Chatham's own, foolies glad I'm home (IGH!)
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on; Rest In Peace to my Vagabond (IGH!)
Rapper song, singer - suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer, held back ass is lowkey still a senior (IGH!)
And I still shake up BO Squad, prayin' for my BroBois (IGH!)
City on the come up, shout that nigga Sosa
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph (IGH!)
Playin' "Buenos Aires" while they sleepin' - buenas noches (IGH!)
Wonder if I wrote this, cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stock broker winter solstice (IGH!)
I could win an Oscar, Russian Accent Husky
Acid addict, costly avid actor - Kevin Costner (AHHHHHHHHH!!!!! TURN UP! TURN UP!)

[Chorus 2X: Chance The Rapper]
Juice! (Juice!) Juice! (Juice!) Juice! (Juice!) Juice! (Juice!)
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

[Chance The Rapper]
God give me one sentence more, maybe I just gotta get suspended more? (IGH!)
Hash tag it, get mentions for it (IGH!) Make you love it, get it trending more (IGH!)
And then act humble, hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you, knowin bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles (IGH!)
But I love y'all souls (IGH!) Don't let the +Juice+ spill Pac
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop the popped bitch in the blue heels yop (IGH!)
That one - drown in the juice nigga; hun'nid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the trynna introduce nigga, everybody know you dude you the new nigga! (IGH!)
Hows it feel to be you? Yo no s√©, I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class, I ain't really been weak since pops smashed
I'm a genius, a mothafuckin pop smash; hit sensei, master
Jack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe, been paid, 10 Day been they FAFSA (AHHHHHHHHH!!!!! TURN UP! TURN UP!)

[Chorus]

[Chance The Rapper]
Juuuuugo.. you never tasted paper
Tripped, racing yaself trynna chase the paper
I just faced a Vega and you love being Kobe when you make the lay up
'til you realize everybody in the world fuckin hates the Lakers
Hahahah, and then everybody wanna sip
'til the juice spill everybody want a bib, and then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth, all you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits and the thirst, just the worst, it's the curse of the juice

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Chance The Rapper - first half over Interlude]
Juice, juice, juice, juice... yup!
Juice, juice, juice, juice... yup!
Juice, juice, juice, juice... yup!
Juice, juice, juice, juice... yup!
Yup! Yup! ...Yup!
