Odd Future, Wolf Gang~!
They are them, we are us
Kill them... all (do it)
Wolf, Gang, Wolf, Gang
Wolf, Gang, Wolf, Gang (c'mon)
Wolf, Gang, Wolf, Gang
Wolf, Gang, bitch bitch over there yell it c'mon
Wolf, Gang, Wolf, Gang
Say it loud, like you mean it!
Wolf, Gang... Wolf, Gang
This nigga had the fuckin nerve to call me immature
The fuck you think I made Odd Future for?
To wear fuckin suits and make good decisions?
Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang

Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well you fuckin up, and truthfully I had enough
and FUCK +Rolling Papers+ I'm a rebel bitch I'm ashin blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
with nice homes, 41K's, and nice-ass lawns
Those privileged fucks gotta learn that we ain't takin no shit
like Ellen Degeneres clitoris is playin with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So if you do, I'm throwin fingers out screamin "fuck you"
I got ten of these, Kennedy's; not Dom
But if I was a Dahm' I would be Jeffery
'preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fuckin "Bout It Bout It" like I'm Master P in ninety-six
It's fuckin immaculate, the way your daughter smackin dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley oop
The Golf Wang hooligans is fuckin up the school again
and showin you and yours that breakin rules is fuckin cool again
(Oh I don't think so) I'm goin harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shovin blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that hoe to know it's me
Ungh~!

[Chorus]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf, Gang, Kill, Them

[Hodgy Beats]
My love is gone for you mommy, you could ride in hearses
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?
You told me life would never ever ever get this perfect
Then you smoked a J of weed and take his kids to the churches
Uhhhhhhh fuck church~! They singin and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I asked him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, lookin for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr!
Ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]

[Hodgy Beats]
It was hilarious, well it ain't fuckin funny now
I'll push this fuckin pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fuckin pounds
"My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds"
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank

[Tyler, the Creator]
Uhhhhh... Free Earl, that's the fuckin shit
And if you disagree, suck a couple pimple-covered dicks
Um... Wolf Gang, that's the fuckin clique
Golf Wang Kill Them All nigga, triple six
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, all them niggaz bitches
We don't need y'all, The Fader's who we really fuckin with
... bitch!

[Outro]
Umm, and...
we don't fuckin make horrorcore, you fuckin idiots
Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box
Wolf Gang
