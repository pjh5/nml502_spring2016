[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
I really made this song just so I could perform it
I don't even know how to beat it

[Tyler, the Creator]
Aw, nah, boy don't cut that wood
Found out his flowers don't smell that good
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need anybody else's nose to win
Look, I am a god
No, I don't pray to society
All you other niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearin' pink and blue
What weak niggas see me?
Nigga, young creators will scream with me
Nigga you don't got drive, you just beep-beep
They wanna talk shit from the back seat
Come and light my fire
I'll blow your FUCKIN' face off
Nigga I'm the GODDAMN pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
... Tie the knot
... Kick the chair
... Float in the air
... It's "Cherry Bomb"

[Tyler, the Creator]
You muthafuckas want war? Then come get it...
You muthafuckas want war? They don't want war...
(Muthafuckas!) Just take me to the gun store
I don't got enough time for you bum ass niggas
I choke your dad, hit your mom cause I don't KNOW that nigga
Come and light my fire
I'll blow your FUCKIN' face off
Nigga, I'm the GODDAMN pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
... Tie the knot
... Kick the chair
... Strangled in the air
... It's "Cherry Bomb"

[Tyler, the Creator]
You muthafuckas want WAAAAAAAAR?!
Fuck that like this that "Cherry Bomb" {*11X*}
Fuck that like this that "Cherry"

[Syd Tha Kyd - repeat 5X]
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up and I lose control

{*Tyler & Syd ad-libs until the end*}
