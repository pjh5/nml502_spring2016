{Tyler you... obviously have some fuckin problems}
{And, this is, this is the end of this session}
{Let's... anythin else you've gotta say?

[Tyler, the Creator]
Mom is gettin jealous I see my manager more
than I see her before, I go on tour and it hurts {yeah}
I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
And getting legal, so now I got to watch the shit that I blurt.. out
{As you should...} My friends are turning into opposites
because my life is turnin into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids who copy shit
Endinh it is all I fuckin think about
That's the shit I think about
All alone, bawlin 'til my muh'fuckin eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile shit gets disgursting
when there's no person around, talkin discussion shit
Man fuck {I'm here to talk} I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
{Who Travis?} Niggaz sayin "Free Earl" without even knowin him
See they're missing a new album, I'm missing my only friend
{You have, everyone around you}
{You're with 30 friends a day, I don't see what it is}
{I mean it's not like you don't have anyone to talk to}
{I'm here for you~! I'm your friend}

[Interlude]
When I say Odd, y'all say Future
Odd... uh-uh nah that shit is corny as fuck
{You do admit, you have a cult following, you're...}
To these white kids? {Oh my gosh!}

[Tyler, the Creator]
Charbroiled nigger on these dark beats
Nauseous with the Nazi but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop see
Mommy was a +Living Single+ +Queen+, with a +Lati'+
So while my wallets piling with some symbolic colored paper
I - lace her, cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
Twenty, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fuckin orphan
Oops, I mean bastard, a skinny-ass disaster
Mom works hard, still workin on her masters
Son lies about, takin classes at community college
just to record some bullshit he calls +Bastard+
Start a fuckin cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got, was a fuckin shitty article in Thrasher

[Interlude]
{Aight, just calm down} That ain't shit man!
{Now don't, don't, don't make yourself seem guilty}
{That, that article was great} No fuck, that mag!
{You're beating yourself up and you're living the fucking life}
{right now kid - when I was your age I would have loved to be}
{fucking doing the things that you're doing right now}
Fuck that~! Fuck all this shit {You act like I'm not here}
You're not! {I'm exactly who you supposed to be talking to}
You don't fuckin help me with shit
YOU DON'T HELP ME WITH SHIT, FUCK!
{That's, that's, who wouldn't do that?)
FUCK YOU! FUCK, YOU! (Who wouldn't, who wouldn't shoot their friends?)
YOU'RE A FUCKING FUCK! I KILLED MY FUCKIN FRIENDS!!
FUCK!!! {We're gonna need security in here and uhh}
I didn't fuckin sign up for this shit!!!
{We're gonna need some mescaline, for him to swallow down right now}
I'm not crazy, I'm a fuckin table, I'm a fuckin table!
{He's losing it} No fuck this shit {Tyler, calm down}

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'mma grab the nina {NO} and find a nice arena
Cause I can't even choose between Ortega or Sabrina
{Get security in here}
And I'm not even human, I'm a body shaped demon
with some semen in my sac and some problems in the back
{Calm the fuck down}
And a life that's fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that's filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one {NO} like a marriage in a church
but this marriage has a hearse, and the parents of the one
that's gettin married has a curse, and it's made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse but, wait it gets worse
All the guests that's in the church, all decided to disperse
{Tyler} So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse
{You don't want to do this}
So they tied the knot, now it's too late to reverse
This arrangement {yes it is} and the nurse is amazed at the hurt
that he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos
he was painting, now a bunch of whispering immerse
{Get him right now, security right there} No get away from me
{Get him} And then the nurse blurts

[Outro]
(What the fuck is his problem?)
(Here, we have two doses to give him, here)
Why didn't anybody ask him first? {GET ON THE GROUND}
{I've been asking you this whole time Tyler}
Because nobody gave a fuck
{Someone gave a fuck Tyler}
{And uhh... the person that gave a fuck was me}
{See, you're not, going crazy}
{It's me, I'm your best friend Tyler}
{I know everything, I know everything about you}
{You've been helping yourself this whole time}
{Your friends, they're just figments of your imagination}
{Dr. TC, see Tyler, I'm your conscience}
{I'm Tron Cat, I'm Ace, I'm Wolf Haley
{I'm...} Me
