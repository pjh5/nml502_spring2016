Artist: Childish Gambino
Album:  I AM JUST A RAPPER
Song:   Bitch Look at Me Now
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

[Childish Gambino]
Sick boy make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried 'bout my wallet bein empty
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin with my Walkman, freestyle rappin
High school bullies like "What the fuck happened?"
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin shot the captain
And this is me relaxing, rapping is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listenin to my mouth on vacation ('ation)
Why you doin this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith, went off without a +Hitch+ man
C-H-I-L-D is the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listenin

[Childish Gambino]
I'ma try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rappin over Grizzly Bear, what the fuck?
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rappin when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rappin cause I fuckin need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make your iPod hotter than a lighter would
Picture me in 6th grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me - I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, cause I'm no better now
Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is +Apatow+
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!
I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sittin shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggaz said would never happen
I'm doin me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need +ER+ like they're +Charlie Park+
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kind of music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on Earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them perc-u-late
We need to separate, nigga church and state
I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after
Nigga stop talking shit, and just be a rapper (be a rapper)</pre>
