[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us

[Childish Gambino]
Anyway~! A New York 9's an everywhere-else 6
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and golddig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuckin hit the lotto but my folks did
.... I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They crossfadin off of Nanos
Ungh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster beiiitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin out in BK
Like, you ain't workin on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a deejay
Like, she listenin to old Freeway
Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different~!
Right, that's why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you, can I have this dance?

[Chorus] - 2X

[Childish Gambino]
We could pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started datin at your art school
Cause either way we both lyin more than half of the time
Except for when I'm home workin on your graphic design
Every time we see each other I'm takin you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian-girl-in-the-back car
But me writin a verse would be the only way they buyin a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats!!
Watchin lames handle they fame
They bang any broad with bangs in a band with an animal name
Hannibal Gein drinkin a handle of Jameson
Anallin anyone is the plan for the evenin and I'm kiddin, stop!
Girl cryin on Ludlow
She still look good though
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass, not a 10, but a +Super 8+
You ain't see me at the show I was super great
Hotel, +Penthouse+, go on and let it roominate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept goin

[Chorus] - 2X

[Interlude]
Ooh girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry? Cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin to say
I'm a piece of shit
Believe in this
I'm tellin you
Cause we barely knew, what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Ohhh-ohhhhh

[Chorus] - 2X
