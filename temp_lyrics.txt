Artist Drake.
Got the club goin' up.
On a Tuesday.
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey.
.
Club goin' up.
.
.
.
Squad goin' up.
Nobody flippin' packs now.
I just did 3 in a row.
Them shows is back to back to back now.
Put the world on our sound.
You know PARTY and The Weeknd.
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time.
To party on the weekend.
Tell Gelo bring the juice.
We about to get lit.
Fill the room up with some tings.
One night off and this is it.
Always workin' OT.
Overtime and out of town.
Shit is crazy back home.
It kills me that I'm not around.
I think we gettin' too deep.
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true.
Upstairs I got xan's in a Advil.
Bottle I don't take them shits but you do.
So I got 'em for you.
I don't need the pills.
I'm just gonna' have another drink.
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend.
I'll look back on this and think.
How we had the club going up.
.

.
.
.
Workin' Monday night.
On the corner flippin' hard.
Made at least 3 thousand.
On the boulevard.
I've been workin' graveyard.
Shifts every other weekend.
Ain't got fuckin' time.
I've been flippin' in the house.
Makin' juugs on the highway.
I've been ridin' out of state.
Makin' money like my way.
I don't think that I should dance.
I'm just gon' have another drink.
I'm doin' my stance.
You know my molly prant.
I got the loudest of the loud.
You know my gas stink.
My P.O. Think I'm in the house.
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think.
.
Club goin' up on a Tuesday.
.
.
.
.
And I know I know how I made it on my own.
I made my own style I don't think that I should stay.
You know I gotta' go.
You're moving too fast.
Don't wanna take it slow.
