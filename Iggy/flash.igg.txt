Album:  Glory
Song:   Flash
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's three in the morning
I'm up and I'm horny
I want you, I want it, I need you upon me
Are you hungry?
Let me know cause I can cook if you coming
Tell me exactly how you want me to look when you're coming
I could be dressed like a schoolgirl, read a book when you're coming
It's ready for you, you could come get the pussy, you want it?
Fresh out the shower, in a towel, ready too
I-O-U like a vowel for hours
We both getting money, I'm just tryna feel the power
Winter, spring, summer till we fall like autumn
Lick me all over like they dipped me in chocolate
Give me LoveRance loving like Mayweather boxing
Beat it up, that's right like I stole something
Beat it up, now I know that made you hungry
Eat it up, I can't wait too much longer
Hurry up, hurry up

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I pray I don't crash
Cause I'm speeding really fast
Yeah I'm racing to your love
And I'll be there in a flash, flash, a flash
I want it bad
I gotta have your sexy ass, yeah yeah uh uh
Foot on the gas, hand on the dash
And I'll be there in a flash, flash, a flash

How long before you hit my exit on the freeway?
We gon' freak and let Pandora DJ
Say you not used to seeing pussy on the TV
Well that's probably cause it's usually on your face
Boy what's up? Damn you're so sexy with that passive aggression
I love when you sweating, that means that you're working around these curves
When you swerving it excites me
The way you just doing it, Nike
Almost like it's two in me, Siamese
My main thing, fuck me good like a side piece
Tell me that I'm beautiful then get it from the side please
And I'll be calling out your name like you need to be reminded

This pussy yours baby, this pussy yours baby
So add some to your food and ham more baby
Cause you got me on lock like a closed door
Now hurry up cause you know what I'm waiting for

[Hook: Mike Posner]
I pray I don't crash
Cause I'm speeding really fast
Yeah I'm racing to your love
And I'll be there in the flash, flash, a flash
I want it bad, uh uh
I gotta have your sexy ass, Iggy uh
Foot on the gas, hand on the dash
And I'll be there in the flash, flash, a flash
And I'll be there in the flash
In the flash

[Outro: Mike Posner]
Uh yeah
Yeah, I can get you diamonds, pearls and shit
You make me wanna start fucking white girls again
You had me switch my whole shit up, real quick in the flash</pre>
