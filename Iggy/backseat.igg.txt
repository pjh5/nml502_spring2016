Artist: Iggy Azalea f/ Chevy Jones
Album:  Ignorant Art
Song:   Backseat
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Sample: Niki & The Dove]
Last night, we got married in a taxi
I swear I loved you, yes I love you like there's no tomorrow
And Iv got no time, for second thoughts now
We got tonight and then I have to go.

(D.R.U.G.S.)

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
I know you want it
So why prolong it?
Perfect time right now
Gimme that look, I'm a hop up on it

Iggy in that zone
And we all alone
Wotchu "waiting on
Lot of woman back here, how bad you want it?

[Pre-Chorus]
Back bone, back on, gonna back that to my back bone
Back strong, back back back my apple, not no iPhone
Backseat, that's our horny ecstasy, popping gon' already see
So there we be, we feel it, yea I'm telling he

[Chorus: Chevy Jones]
Give it to him down in the parking lot
That's true love, that's true love
Give it to him down in the parking lot
That's true him, that's true love
Give it to him down in the parking lot
That's true love, that's true love
Give it to him down in the parking lot
In the backseat, in the backseat of the car"

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Here we go, up and down to the beat
Never caring if they peep 'cause the windows fog
Gotta get it when I get it, get it right, get it good
Get it good while it's good, it's the shit for all

I don't really do this with all
But the way you touch me, my dress come off
Drop get you rocking then the top come off
And my top come off then we bring it hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Back bone, back on, gonna back that to my back bone
Back strong, back back back my apple, not no iPhone
Backseat, that's our horny ecstasy, popping gon' already see
So there we be, we feel it, yea I'm telling he

[Chorus: Chevy Jones]
Give it to him down in the parking lot
That's true love, that's true love
Give it to him down in the parking lot
That's true him, that's true love
Give it to him down in the parking lot
That's true love, that's true love
Give it to him down in the parking lot
In the backseat, in the backseat of the car

[Bridge x4: Iggy Azalea (Chevy Jones)]
Back gone
Can't wait to get that home
I want that (backseat love)
I want that (backseat love)</pre>
