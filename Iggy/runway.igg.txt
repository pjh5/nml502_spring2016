Artist: Iggy Azalea f/ Pusha T (Clipse)
Album:  Glory
Song:   Runway
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Put everything in a suitcase one day
And run away to the runway
To find somewhere to lay my heart (lay my heart)
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going
To find somewhere to lay my heart
Home's wherever I lay my heart

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
You ever start to feel that home wasn't your home
Kinda like somebody made you wear the wrong clothes
What you say ain't gotta be what you made of
Well see your heart don't always match where you came from
Couldn't see you so they treat you like a misfit
Because your mind clicks in another district
Call you fake but they don't know what's inside you
Cause what's inside justifies what divides you
Searching for that place right where you wanna be
That's really real where it's never full capacity
Throw that and get away, never come back, don't go the wrong way

[Chorus]
Put everything in a suitcase one day
And run away to the runway
To find somewhere to lay my heart
Home's wherever I lay my heart
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going
To find somewhere to lay my heart
Home's wherever I lay my heart

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
They say home's where you hang your hat
So beware of the owner cause he bang his gap
International kush and I clean my set
All over the globe V.A. I rep
And it still ain't enough for the haters
Put on for my city, light it up like it's Vegas
How you frontin' on, Ali, I'm the greatest
Float like a butterfly, the porsche ride amazing
I feel like Speedracer
Margielas in the Louis Duffle
MCM hold the Fendi buckle
Paw, that's what I call an interracial couple
Along with poppin' sounds, that's a power struggle

[Chorus]
Put everything in a suitcase one day
And run away to the runway
To find somewhere to lay my heart
Home's wherever I lay my heart
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going
To find somewhere to lay my heart
Home's wherever I lay my heart

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Change my longitude, and my latitude
To get an attitude, that shit gratitude
But my mind's gone until I find home
Then I can get my shine on, no rhinestones
Then I can get my shine on, no rhinestones
See you later with my bags, I'm gone

[Chorus]
Put everything in a suitcase one day
And run away to the runway
To find somewhere to lay my heart
Home's wherever I lay my heart
If you see me rollin' that's where I'm going
To find somewhere to lay my heart
Home's wherever I lay my heart</pre>
