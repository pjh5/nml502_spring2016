Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Look, we gettin' money
We spendin' money
There's june money and decemeber money
Theres summer money and winter money
Cold-co-co-co-cold
Clothes on top of clothes
I'm flyer than a bird and I'm shittin' on you hoes
Whatchu know bitch I'm on
And can't nobody turn me off
And if I was a dick I would be hard but you would make me soft, my god
He's choosing like hello hello so pretty bitch hey yellow yellow
Blond but please don't think I'm dumb
I'm getting to this bread [?]
Where's there grey poupon
These dudes is on my jock
Everytime I come you would think I was trippin shit the way they throw them ones at me

I can make you go
I can make you move
I can make you do what the fuck I want you to do
I walk in they like hello hello hello
I walk in they like hello hello hello [x2]

Fuck you bitches
You ugly bitches
You stupid bitches
You dummy bitches
You dusty bitches
Don't touch me bitches whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
No no no no no
You're not on my level
You're not even close
These are ferragamo baby
What the fuck are those?
Since you sniff pussies and cry baby
Go and blow your nose
Bitch I'm on
And if I have to tell you one more time I'll blow
Like a bomb, or a horn, or a bitch behind a bungalow at prom
What I'm on
I swear these bitches not
This pussy two times. twat, twat
Pussy two more times is exactly what he got
After I made it hot and he spent up all his gwap
I'm talking racks on top of racks
And stacks on top of that
He took me to the shops and I got bags on top of bags
You just like orphan annie get a kitchen back them rags
You're not lookin' too good and that's too bad so sad

I can make you go
I can make you move
I can make you do what the fuck I want you to do
I walk in they like hello hello hello
I walk in they like hello hello hello [x2]</pre>
