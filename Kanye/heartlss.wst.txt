[Chorus]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me though
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know its some things that you ain't told me
Ayo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna give me back and you gonna show me
So you walk round like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cuz I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that ya leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless?

[Verse 3]
Talkin' talkin' talkin' thaw
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gonna keep hatin me
And we just gonna be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gonna take off tonight
Into the night

[Chorus]
In the night I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh
How could you be so heartless
