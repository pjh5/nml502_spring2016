All of the lights
(All of the lights)
Lights, lights
All of the lights

[Chorus]
Turn up the lights in here baby 
Extra bright I want you all to see this
Turn up the lights in here baby 
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights (Turn up the lights)

Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, All of the lights
Until it figures exactly where we are
All of the lights, All of the lights
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life

[Kanye West]
Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone, a nigga dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take em to that ghetto university

All of the lights
Lights! Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
strobe lights, street lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
Fast life, drug life
thug life, rock life
Every night
(All of the lights)

[Chorus]
Turn up the lights in here baby 
Extra bright I want you all to see this
Turn up the lights in here baby 
You know what I need
want you to see everything
want you to see all of the lights

[Kanye West]
Restraining order
Can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bump my head
Courts suck me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

All of the lights
Lights! Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
strobe lights, street lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
Fast life, drug life
thug life, rock life
Every night
(All of the lights)

[Chorus]
Turn up the lights in here baby 
Extra bright I want you all to see this
Turn up the lights in here baby 
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
want you to see all of the lights 

Get in mind baby
Gotta let this nigga know
Get it right babe
She going get your own
Get in mind baby
Gotta let this nigga know
Get it right babe
She going get your own

Unemployment line/credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind (my mind)
And I also was about to do that line
Ok ok you know we going all the way this time
(this time, this time)
We going all the way this time
(this time, this time)
We going all the way this time

We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

Turn up the lights in here baby 
Extra bright I want you all to see this
Turn up the lights in here baby 
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Oh woah, oh woah, oh 
I tried to tell you but all I can say is wrong
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
I tried to tell you but all I can say is wrong
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
I tried to tell you but all I can say is wrong
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
I tried to tell but all I can say
