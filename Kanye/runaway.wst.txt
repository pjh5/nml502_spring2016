[Intro]
"Look at ya!" {*12X*}
"Look at ya!" {*6X*}
"Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen!"
"Look at ya!" {*6X*}

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin wrong
You been puttin up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan; run away fast as you can

[Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
And I always find

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Kanye West] {*w/ sample ad libs*}
Run away from me baby... run away
Run away from me baby... run away
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, just run away
This is my plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me baby... run away
Run away from me baby... run away
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy; why can't she just, run away?
Baby I got a plan, run away as fast as you can

[Pusha T]
24/7, 365
Pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I, I did it, alright alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you can leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin knock-offs
Ha, knock it off, Neiman's shop it off
Let's talk over Mai Tais, waitress top it off
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
comes with a price tag, baby face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in a baller nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich and tasteless
P~!

[Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killin me
I guess you knew you at an advantage
Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Chorus]
