Artist: Kanye West f/ Kid Cudi, Raekwon 
[Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
 
[Kanye West - Verse 1]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
and eventually answers to the call of Autumn
all of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
get caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
intercentury anthems based off inner city tantrums
based off the way we was branded
face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
but we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
this the real world, homie, school finished
they done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?
 
[Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
 
[Kanye West - Verse 2]
Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
the soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
as long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
but they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
if a nigga aint shootin a jumpshot, running a track meet
but this pimp is, ar the top of mount Olympus
ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
we make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
choke a south park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
and these drugs, niggas cant resist it
remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
if I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

[Kanye West - Verse 3]
I need more drinks and less lights
and that American Apparel girl in just tights
she told the director she tryna get into school
he said “take them glasses off and get in the pool”
it's been a while since I watched the tube
cause like a crip set, I got way too many blues for anymore bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
they rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
and what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
but God said I need a different approach
cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
it's not funny anymore try different jokes
tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
act like I aint had a belt and two classics
I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
you blowing up, that's good, fantastic
that y'all, its like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
cause the same people that tried to blackball me
forgot about 2 things, my black balls
 
[Kid Cudi - Chorus]
 
[Raekwon]
I done copped Timbs and lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
counting up, smoking, one cuff
live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
steam about a hundred and one L's
kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
nigga hat game was special
it matched every black pair of Nikes
throwing dice for decimals
the older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
that meant code red
bent off the black skunk
the black dutch, back of the old shed
if you can't live, you dying
you give or buy in
keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
 
[Kid Cudi]
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
no more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
