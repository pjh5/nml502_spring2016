[Intro]
I'm with this...

[Chorus] (Pete Rock)
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Ooooooooh complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh...
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
...Sneak (dissin!)
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill witcha
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if massa listenin, cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh....
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the morning sun
Brown-skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your momma can't run
...Sneak (dissin!)
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill witcha
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if massa listenin, I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin that's vital and critical for survival
of mankind, if he lyin, color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces, then wit told me,
"A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation, I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You like it, I love it {8X}

(Woo-WOO-WOO-WOO-WOO)

(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
 I need you to speak yo' mind real quick, loved one!)

[Rapsody]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, 'scuse me on my 2Pac
+Keep Your Head Up+, when did you stop... loving thy...
color of your skin, color of your eyes?
That's the real +Blue's+, baby, like you met Jay's baby
Uh... you blew me away
You think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, +12 Years a Slave+
12 years of age, thinkin my shade too dark
+I love myself+, I no longer need Cu-pid
Enforcin my dark side like a young George Lu-cas
Light don't mean you smart, bein dark don't make you stu-pid
And frame of mind for them +Bustas+, ain't talkin +WOO-HAH~!+
Need a paradox for the pair of daughters they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see you're beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, uh that's the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain't talkin Jay, mm-mmm, I ain't talkin B
I'm talkin +Daze+ we got +School+ watchin movie screens
And +Spike+ your self esteem, the new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thing

{"Barefoot babies with no cares...
 Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?...
 I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
 The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth}
